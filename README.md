# HR-Dashboard
## Project Description 
This project features a comprehensive HR Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to help stakeholders analyze workforce data and support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard is structured across three main pages:

- Home Page – Presents high-level KPIs and a workforce overview, including Total Employees, Active Employees, Due for Promotion, Total Years of Service, Job Level Distribution, and more.

- Detail Page – Delivers deeper analysis of employee Job Roles, Job Satisfaction Levels, and tracks trends over time, helping to understand workforce dynamics.

- Action Page – Focuses on actionable insights, highlighting employees who are Due for Promotion and those Due for Retrenchment, supporting strategic HR planning.

Each page includes interactive visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and slicers to allow users to explore the data dynamically. The dashboard aims to improve HR efficiency, support strategic planning, and uncover employee trends across the organization.
